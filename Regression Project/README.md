# Regression and Forecasting Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a linear multi-variable regression model to establish a relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and multiple independent variables (X1 to X5). The aim is to use statistical analysis and regression techniques to forecast outcomes based on historical data.

## Objectives

- To perform basic statistical analysis for understanding data distribution and identifying outliers.
- To implement simple linear regression for parameter estimation and model significance testing.
- To conduct multi-variable linear regression to predict outcomes and evaluate model performance.

## Approach

### Task 1: Basic Statistical Analysis

- Calculation of histograms, means, and variances for each variable.
- Removal of outliers using box plots.
- Calculation of a correlation matrix to assess dependencies among variables.

### Task 2: Simple Linear Regression

- Estimation of model parameters and assessment of model significance through p-values and R-squared values.
- Visualization of the regression line and analysis of residuals to ensure normal distribution and independence.

### Task 3: Multi-variable Linear Regression

- Implementation of a multi-variable regression model to determine coefficients.
- Evaluation of model performance and variable significance.
- Residuals analysis to verify assumptions of normality and independence.

## Conclusion

This project leverages statistical packages and Python for analyzing and modeling data to predict outcomes. Through systematic analysis and regression techniques, it aims to provide insights into data relationships and forecast future trends.
